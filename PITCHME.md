Current situation
===

Common issues in our projects:
@ul
* Out-of-control: No clear process on how-to/which libraries/which verion to use.
* N+1 library: One problem can be solved by multiple libraries, no standardization among projects.
* Reinventing the wheel: reimplementing features that already exist in frameworks
* Lack of standards: No clear process on framework versions/upgrades/standards among teams.
* Heterogeneous development practices: different projects follow different test/deployment strategies
* Vulnerability tracking: Lack of CVE(Common Vulnerability and Exposures) tracking
* Old versions: Tendency to fall behind on versions
